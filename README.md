# Alexandria
Book List App

- Users can add books to the list by scanning barcode or manually entering ESBN number.
- Users can view/search books in an existing list and click on book title to view details. 
- Alexandriaâ€™s barcode scanning functionality does not require the installation of a separate app.

This project was part of Super Duo project at Udacity.
